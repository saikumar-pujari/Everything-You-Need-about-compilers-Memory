# transition of a compiler is done in 8 phases 
It converts each character sequence into a preprocessing token sequence. These tokens and preprocessing numbers together form a superset that represents the union of all token sets, where tokens act as transition units.
Preprocessing tokens are separated by whitespace.
The maximal munch rule is applied during this process — it ensures that the longest possible sequence of characters is always converted into a single valid preprocessing token when decomposing the source file.
Translation phases
  Phase 1: Mapping source characters
  Phase 2: Splicing lines
  Phase 3: Lexing
  Phase 4: Preprocessing
  Phase 5: Determining common string literal encodings
  Phase 6: Concatenating string literals
  Phase 7: Compiling
  Phase 8: Instantiating templates
  Phase 9: Linking

The text of a C++ program is kept in units called source files.
C++ source files undergo translation to become a translation unit, consisting of the following steps:
  Maps each source file to a character sequence.
  Converts each character sequence to a preprocessing token sequence, separated by whitespace.
  Converts each preprocessing token to a token, forming a token sequence.
  Converts each token sequence to a translation unit.
